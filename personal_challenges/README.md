# Personal Challenges for CTFd

This CTFd plugin creates a possibility to create individual flag for each player.

Within CTFd you are free to mix and match regular, dynamic and personal challenges .

The current implementation works only with individual flags!

Individual Flags can be created by APG app https://gitlab.fi.muni.cz/kypolab/theses/apg/kosc-automated-problem-generation-app .


# Installation

**REQUIRES: CTFd >= v1.2.0**

1. Clone this repository to `CTFd/plugins`. It is important that the folder is
   named `personal_challenges` so CTFd can serve the files in the `assets`
   directory.
